3. Strengthen collaboration across functions by promoting transparency and accountability in issue tracking, communication, and closure. 
4. Reduce recurrence and mitigate negative impacts on operations, quality, and delivery through structured problem elevation, root cause analysis, and targeted corrective actions. 
5. Promote ongoing process enhancement and quality system development by documenting, reviewing, and evaluating escalated issues based on their severity and frequency.
